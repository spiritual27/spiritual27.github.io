    <p>This simple fried rice is as good for breakfast as it is for dinner. Thick-cut bacon will make for more meaty, chewy bits. Cookbook writer Amy Thielen often adds a little sauerkraut for a further Midwestern touch.</p>

Add the rice, cilantro stems, and the sugar and cook, breaking up the rice with your spatula, until the rice is warmed through, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the center of the rice and add the remaining egg. Cook the egg, stirring, until the eggs are cooked and scrambled, about 1 minute. Stir in the rice to combine, along with the remaining 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, the minced cilantro, and half the scallion greens. Transfer to a platter and garnish with reserved bacon, the strips of egg, the remaining scallion greens, and the minced cilantro.</li>
