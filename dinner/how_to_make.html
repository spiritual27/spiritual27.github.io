<h1>PUT BACON IN YOUR FRIED RICE</h1>
<h2>And plenty of eggs, as good for breakfast as it is for dinner</h2>

<p><q>Fried rice is a dish that just begs to be corrupted. It's like hash, there's no real canon for it.</q>So says Amy Thielen, cookbook author, SAVEUR contributor, and smart thinker of Midwestern foodâ€”and so say we all. And that's where we're starting a new video series:<strong>Modern Midwest</strong>, with simple recipes from Thielen that fall into her heavy weeknight cooking rotation.</p>
<p>To kick things off: Fried rice. But with lots and lots of thick-cut bacon and more egg than you might be used to. In addition to what normally gets cracked into the rice and stir-fried, Thielen also makes an omelet that she cuts into strips for more pillowy bites of egg in between crisp rice, seared cabbage, and some homemade sauerkraut for a bright touch.<q>This is what I make when I get home and have no idea what to make. None.</q></p>
