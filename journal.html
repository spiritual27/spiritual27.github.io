<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
<q>Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity.</q>
I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>

<h2>June 2, 2012</h2>
<p>My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
everything packed and ready to go.</p> 
Because I'm on a Segway,I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
<ol>
<li>cellphone</li>
<li>iPod</li>
<li>digital camera</li>
<li>a protein bar</li>
</ol>
Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said, 
<q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
